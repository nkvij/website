I am final year B.Tech-M.Tech Dual Degree student in the [Electrical Engineering Department](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. My research interests lie in Quantum Optics and Quantum Computing. Feels odd for a EE major doing physics? I would like to thank CHM102, an introductory couse on quantum mechanics for kindling this affair.

I had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Shilpi Gupta](https://sites.google.com/site/sguptaiitk/) at the [Quantum Photonics Research Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/labquantumphotonics/) since my sophomore year. Starting with introductory quantum mechanics and quantum optics, Shilpi ma'am painstakingly helped me navigate through the quantum realm. In the past two years, I worked on several problems with her, developing theoretical and computational models to study the rich physics of interacting hybrid quantum mechanical systems. For my Master's thesis, I will work in collaboration with Prof. Saikat Ghosh at the [Quantum Measurements Lab]((https://sites.google.com/site/saikatghoshiitk/home) ), characterizing the optomechanical response of graphene. 

Apart from academia, I spend my time reading high-fantasy novels, trying to beat my best 5K run time (currently at 29:40), and exploring new music.
