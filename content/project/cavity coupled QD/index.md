As an experimantally observed fact, the cavity resonance frequency shifts towards the quantum dot resonance frequency when coupled and pumped incoherently. In this project, I intend to calculate the susceptibility and hence the refractive index of a system which comprises of N identical two-level emitters (TLE) weakly coupled to a cavity mode. Here, the TLE are essentially an approximated model for colloidal quantum dots. The TLE are being pumped with the help of a laser which is far from its resonance and is thus taken as an incoherent pump using Lindblad superoperator. We take into account losses due to leaky cavity and spontaneous emission from the excited state to ground state.
