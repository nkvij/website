Semiconductor crystals are known to have atoms arranged in a periodic fashion. These atoms are continuously vibrating about their mean position which are caused when the atoms absorb thermal energy ($\sim 26$ meV at room temperature) from the surrounding environment. To model these atoms and the vibrating behavior, we consider the crystal lattice points where atoms are present as points of infinite potential. The vibrations are then considered as sinusoidal time dependent perturbations of these ’infinite potential walls.’ We use this simple model to study the effect of these vibrations on the probability density distribution of the electrons confined in these potential wells.
