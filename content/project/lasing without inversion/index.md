Traditionally, for lasers to work, a population inversion between two energy levels is necessary for the gain to overcome the loss threshold. The population inversion is achieved by pumping the gain medium with a power greater than the loss threshold, which depends on the frequency of laser operation and the coupling between the gain medium and lasing field mode. The threshold pump power scales as $\omega^6$ for natural broadening and $\omega^4$ in the case of Doppler broadening [[1]](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1464-4266/2/3/201). Thus, to construct lasers in the high-frequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum, extensive pumping powers are necessary which limits the concept of inversion to achieve continuous-wave lasing output in the high-frequency region such as in x-rays. To overcome this bottleneck, the idea of Lasing Without Inversion (LWI) steps in. It differs from the traditional lasing in the fact that the reciprocity between stimulated emission and absorption is broken. Absorption is suppressed or eliminated in the case of LWI thus even a small population in the higher energy level can induce lasing.

In this project, I discuss the idea of hidden population inversion in two and three level systems and how the absorption profile of the gain medium can be altered thus achieving Electromagnetically induced transparency.
